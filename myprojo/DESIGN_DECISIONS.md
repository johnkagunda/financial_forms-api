## Form Architecture ðŸ“‹

### Decision: Three-Model Design (Form â†’ Fields â†’ Responses)
**Chosen Architecture**:
```
Form (1) â†’ (N) Field â†’ (N) FieldResponse â†’ (1) Submission
```

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic field creation without schema migrations
- **Type Safety**: Dedicated storage columns for different data types
- **Validation**: Field-level validation rules and conditional logic
- **Analytics**: Easy aggregation and reporting on field responses

**Alternative Considered**: JSON Schema-Based Forms
- **Pros**: Single table storage, schema flexibility, simpler queries
- **Cons**: Limited query capabilities, validation complexity, poor analytics support
- **Verdict**: Normalized design provides better query performance and data integrity

**Alternative Considered**: EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) Pattern
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, single response table
- **Cons**: Complex queries, poor performance, type safety issues
- **Verdict**: Hybrid approach with typed columns offers better balance

## API Design ðŸ”Œ

### Decision: Multiple ViewSets with Different Perspectives
**Chosen Approach**: 
- `SubmissionViewSet` - Admin-focused submission management
- `FormResponsesViewSet` - Form-centric analytics and response viewing  
- `FieldResponsesViewSet` - Client-focused submission API

**Rationale**:
- **Use Case Optimization**: Each ViewSet optimized for specific workflows
- **Serializer Flexibility**: Different data representations for different consumers
- **Permission Granularity**: Fine-grained access control per endpoint
- **API Clarity**: Clear endpoint purposes reduce integration confusion

**Alternative Considered**: Single Unified API
- **Pros**: Simpler structure, fewer endpoints to document
- **Cons**: Generic responses, complex parameter handling, mixed concerns
- **Verdict**: Multiple ViewSets provide better developer experience

### Decision: Flexible Input Formats
**Chosen Approach**: Support both key-value and array-based submission formats

```json
// Option 1: Key-Value
{"answers": {"Full Name": "John", "Age": 30}}

// Option 2: Array-Based  
{"answers_list": [{"field_id": 1, "value": "John"}]}
```

**Rationale**:
- **Integration Flexibility**: Supports different client implementation patterns
- **Field Matching**: Tolerant label matching with slugification reduces errors
- **Backward Compatibility**: Easy to add new formats without breaking changes

## Data Storage Strategy ðŸ’¾

### Decision: Hybrid Response Storage
**Chosen Approach**: Multiple typed columns in `FieldResponse` model

```python
value_text = TextField()
value_number = FloatField() 
value_date = DateField()
value_boolean = BooleanField()
value_json = JSONField()
```

**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Proper data types enable database-level constraints and indexing
- **Query Performance**: Efficient filtering and aggregation on typed columns
- **Flexibility**: JSON field handles complex data structures (arrays, files)
- **Analytics**: Easy statistical calculations on numeric/date fields

**Alternative Considered**: Single JSON Column
- **Pros**: Simple schema, maximum flexibility, easy schema changes
- **Cons**: Poor query performance, no type constraints, complex analytics
- **Verdict**: Typed columns provide better performance and data integrity

**Alternative Considered**: Dynamic Table Creation
- **Pros**: Native SQL types, optimal performance
- **Cons**: Complex migrations, schema management overhead, deployment complexity
- **Verdict**: Hybrid approach balances flexibility with performance
